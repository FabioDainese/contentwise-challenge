# Future Possible Improvements

- Complete the 3rd step (i.e. `/app/(pokemon-wizard-pages)/oppenent-team-selection` page)
- Add some caching techniques (e.g. using `react-query` or `SWR`)
- Add `Storybook` (in which you can also do some testing with **_Jest_**)
- Add SEO related stuff (e.g. metadata, title, description, favicon, etc.)

**NB**: These implementations have not been completed yet due to time constraints
